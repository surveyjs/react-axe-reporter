# React Axe HTML Reporter

A React-based HTML reporter that integrates with [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility checker to report any web accessibility issues that might make it hard for people with disabilities to use your application. It provides an interactive and visually appealing UI that displays accessibility testing results as a list of passed and failed accessibility checks, along with detailed information about each issue.

Developed by the SurveyJS team, this axe reporter is designed to make it easier for developers to interpret accessibility test results for dynamic forms built with the Survey Creator component and validate their WCAG compliance.

## Features

- üìä Visual percentage gauge showing overall accessibility score
- üìã Summary table of accessibility violations
- üîç Detailed view of each accessibility rule check
- üìë Collapsible sections for passed and failed checks
- üè∑Ô∏è WCAG tag formatting and categorization
- üì± Responsive design
- üé® Customizable styling through CSS modules
